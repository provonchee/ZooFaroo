<div class="about-content">
<p>ZooFaroo is a simple by design online social marketplace and resource where neighbors and small businesses can trade, buy, sell, barter, and promote themselves within in their community.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zoofaroo.com/Oregon/Portland.html">To see some active posts click here for ZooFaroo Portland</a></p>

<p>ZooFaroo has many uses:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's a place for the private individual or small business to swap or sell their goods and services with their community.</li>

<li>It's a place to promote your small business or your talents (e.g. a aspiring artist, baby sitter, performer, carpenter, etc.) and tap into markets that otherwise would be out of reach.</li> 

<li>It's a place to have a 'soft' introduction through a user's ratings, reviews, facebook page, google plus page, or their own website. It's a way to get to know a little bit more about the person or business that you're potentially going to have an exchange with.</li>
</ol>


<p>Visit ZooFaroo to check out the many offers or needs left by neighbors or local businesses.  Take a moment to add a post or two of your own, then browse the site and leave some reviews.  Showcase your professional skills, or get creative and offer up that old refrigerator in your basement in exchange for help tiling an outdated bathroom!</p>
<p>ZooFaroo is a community that encourages everyone to help out their neighbors, share the benefits of hard work and see the benefits of reaching out to those in your community.  A single visit to ZooFaroo will show you how a fun functional online social marketplace can bring out the best in you and your community!</p>

<div class='about-image'><img src="images/register.jpg" alt="ZooFaroo Register" width="620" height="800"/></div>

<p>These links will show up on your <a href="http://www.zoofaroo.com/user/1.html">ZooFaroo User Page</a> (viewable to the ZooFaroo community) along with your current posts and user reviews left for you by other users.&nbsp;&nbsp;PLEASE NOTE: Your email addres is <u><b>never</b></u> visible on the User Information Page.  We value your privacy and will never sell your information to anyone.</p>

<div class='about-image'><img src="images/userInfo.jpg" alt="ZooFaroo User Info" width="620" height="365"/></div>

<p>While the link information is optional we do encourage you to include at least one or two simply because it is a great way for ZooFaroo members to have a <a href="http://www.zoofaroo.com/blog/zoofaroo-and-the-soft-introduction/">'soft introduction'</a> before an exchange takes place.</p>

<p>Once registered, you can <a href="http://www.zoofaroo.com/post.html">post</a> as many 'offers' and 'needs' as you'd like.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you need a lawnmower?&nbsp;&nbsp;Post that as a 'need'.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have a cottage to rent?&nbsp;&nbsp;Post that as an 'offer'.</p>

<div class='about-image'><img src="images/post.jpg" alt="ZooFaroo Post" width="620" height="137"/></div>

<p>And don't worry, you don't have to post eveything at once.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can post one 'offer' today and two 'needs' next week, it all gets saved to your <a href="http://www.zoofaroo.com/edit.html">User Account</a>.</p>

<div class='about-image'><img src="images/postForm.jpg" alt="ZooFaroo Posting Form" width="620" height="454"/></div>

<p>We understand that sometimes you will need something where time is of the essence, or you just really want what you want, like tickets to the show that weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp;If that's the case just tick the 'in addition to trades I am willing to pay money for what I need' box&nbsp;<img src="images/money.png" alt="Open to paying for what they need" width="15" height="15"/>&nbsp; when filling out the post.&nbsp;&nbsp;No one wants you to miss the show this weekend!</p>

<div class='about-image'><img src="images/needPostMoney.jpg" alt="ZooFaroo Willing to Pay Post" width="620" height="272"/></div>

<p>Once your posts are active, interested ZooFaroo users will be able to <a href="http://www.zoofaroo.com/Oregon/Portland.html">browse</a> your 'offers' and 'needs' independently.</p>

<div class='about-image'><img src="images/postList.jpg" alt="ZooFaroo Posting Offer Lists" width="620" height="141"/></div>
<div class='about-image'><img src="images/needList.jpg" alt="ZooFaroo Posting Need Lists" width="620" height="143"/></div>

<p>If users are interesteed in what you're 'offering' or what you 'need' in they'll <a href="http://www.zoofaroo.com/Oregon/Portland/Offered/Cell_Phones/2.html">'Reply to your Post'</a> with offers.&nbsp;&nbsp;In turn, as a registered user, you can feel free to browse other users 'offers' and 'needs' and reply as you like.</p>

<div class='about-image'><img src="images/postOffer.jpg" alt="ZooFaroo Posting Need Lists" width="620" height="606"/></div>

<p>If you're a business and you'd like to promote it, first make sure you fill out the optional info on the register page (facebook link, twitter link, link to your own website, etc) and then post an offer of what your company offers, e.g., pet care, house painting, cooking supplies, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're not interested in bartering or trade offers simply tick the 'only accept money offers box'&nbsp;<img src="images/onlyMoney.png" alt="Only Accepts Money Offers" width="15" height="15"/>&nbsp;when you post.</p>

<div id="about-content" style="padding:10px;"><div id="about-photo"><img src="images/josh&joel.jpg" alt="Joel and Josh/"><br/>Joel and Josh<br/><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/joel-hokkanen/46/25b/274">Joel's LinkedIn Page</a><br/><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/joshua-provonchee/23/b16/818">Joshua's LinkedIn Page</a></div>
Joel and Josh grew up together in mid-coast Maine, where their friendship began at age fourteen.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the perfect formula of creativity, brainpower, compatibility, and drive and determination they knew a joint project was on the horizon.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since then, they’ve been waiting for that one main ingredient: a great idea. 
<br/><br/>
Cut to many years later, Joel is a veterinarian running low cost animal clinics in Southern Maine.&nbsp;&nbsp;Josh is living in Portland, Oregon working as a web designer and developer. 
<br/><br/>
A phone call from Joel.&nbsp;&nbsp;He has an idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;'What about a site that allows people to trade their goods and services?'
<br/><br/>
The great idea we've been looking for.
<br/><br/>
We brainstorm.  We develop.  We fine tune.
<br/><br/>
What if we create a symbiotic environment that brings people together, where everyone wins?&nbsp;&nbsp;A place where it doesn't matter if you have a lot of money, stuff, or skills, you'll find a way to benefit while benefitting others.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has something to offer and everyone has something they need.
<br/><br/>
A few months later ZooFaroo is born, a place where anyone can come to browse posts, post their own, leave a review, or promote themselves, where all are free to showcase skills or offer up that old refrigerator, or send a shout out that a bathroom needs tiling.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a community of equality, balance, and fair trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s fun, functional, and productive.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s ZooFaroo.</div><!--about-content-->
